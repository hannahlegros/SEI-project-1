## What's going on?

You've been left behind on a strange planet. These weird, ugly creatures that call themselves "humans" keep trying to take you to a place called "Area 51". Avoid the humans so they don't steal your energy and pick up boosters along the way to keep up your energy. If you reach the energy threshold, you will stay alive long enough for your fam to show up. Lose all your energy and you'll be captured by the humans and sent to Area 51.

## MVP Checklist

* Render the starting screen with a Start button
* Render the game area, starting energy meter, and message board
* Render alien and allow movement with WASD keys/ define "gravity"
* Render bad humans and energy boosters
* Give constant, set motion to humans and boosters
* Increase energy when alien comes in contact with booster and remove booster from screen
* Decrease energy when alien comes in contact with humans
* Define winning parameters and annouce a win 
* Define losing parameters and annouce a loss
* Render a restart button and add functionality

## Stretch Goals

* More in-depth styling
* Add levels where the humans and boosters advance more quickly
* To add difficulty to levels, render more humans and fewer boosters

## Potential Roadblocks

* Figuring out how to render gravity
* Restart button functionality
* Getting humans and boosters to move on their own across the screen
