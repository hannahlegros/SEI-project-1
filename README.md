## What's going on?

You've been left behind on a strange planet. These weird, ugly aliens that call themselves "humans" keep trying to take you to a place called "Area 51". Avoid the humans so they don't steal your energy and pick up ??  along the way to keep up your energy. If you reach the energy threshold, you will stay alive long enough for your fam to show up. Lose all your energy and you'll be captured by the humans and sent to Area 51. 

## Tech Stack

* HTML (Canvas)
